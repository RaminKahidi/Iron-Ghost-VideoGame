## General Information
Iron Ghost is a small personal project I built to explore a new type of game mechanic where the main chacter actually gains power when hit by enemies.
This game was build in the Unity Game Engine.

The main game mechanic revolves around switching between a suited and non suited version of the 
main chacter based on how many hits you have taken from enemies. This game mechanic makes it so that as you take more hits, 
you gain access to more abilities, however at the same time if you take too many hits, you can die as the suit overpowers the body. 

This current release simply features the basic game mechanics of the game. 

## Date of Release
* This game was built in the Unity Game engine in August of 2020
